Additional material includes Pennsylvanian, Permian, and Cretaceous compression-impression specimens from several localities in eastern and central Kansas and coal balls from the Midcontinent, USA. The Division of Paleobotany was instituted in 1995 when Edith L. Taylor and Thomas N. Taylor moved to the University of Kansas, bringing their extensive collection of fossil plants with them. The Taylor Collection and the Baxter Collection of mostly Kansas coal balls formed the core of the KU Paleobotany collection, but we have acquired other so-called orphaned collections, including portions of the collections of Ted Delevoryas (Triassic of North Carolina; Jurassic of Mexico), Lawrence C. Matten (Devonian of Ireland), Gar W.

Roosevelt, the Patuxent Research Refuge is the nation's only national wildlife refuge established to support wildlife research. It is located located between Washington, DC and Baltimore, MD. At the time of the Refuge's establishment in 1936, botanist Neil Hotchkiss and other scientists surveyed the flora on the 2,650 acres which made up the Refuge. Lists of plants found on the Refuge were published in 1940 and 1947. The latter list tabulated 944 plant taxa. Voucher specimens were collected and reposited in the Refuge's herbarium. By 1980, when the refuge expanded to 4,741 acres, a total of 900 plant taxa were listed. In the early 1990's as part of the Base Re-alignment and Closure (BRAC) process, the Department of Defense transferred about 8,100 acres of land from Fort Meade to the Department of Interior, with control of the land given to the Fish and Wildlife Service. The addition of this parcel, now known as the North Tract, brought the total acreage of the Refuge to over 12,800 acres. A floral survey of the North Tract began in 2010 and a re-survey of the older parcel of the Refuge, known as the Central and South Tracts, was initiated in 2013. As of December 2017, the herbarium holds almost 5,000 voucher specimens from over 1,250 taxa found on the Refuge. This includes a number of Maryland rare, threatened, and endangered (RTE) species, as well as at least five species new to Maryland. A number of duplicate and unique voucher specimens are held by other herbaria.","",NA,NA,"","Maryland, U.S.A","","Bill Harms","","botanybill@verizon.net","10901 Scarlet Tanager Loop","Laurel","Maryland","201708","10901 Scarlet Tanager Loop","Laurel","Maryland","201708","","","","","","","",39.0264,-76.8012,5045,"plantae"

The completion of a Revised Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Bandelier National Monument (Jacobs 2012) represents the first significant update to the flora of the monument in the 20 years since completion of the initial Flora of Bandelier project (Jacobs, 1989). Over 50 additional taxa are documented for the monument, bringing the total from around 746 species in 1989 to 800+ in 2012. The relatively high diversity of vascular plants (800+ taxa documented for 33,000 acre area) reflects the complex topography and wide range of climatic settings available across a nearly 5000-foot elevation range from the Rio Grande at 5300-feet to the summit of Cerro Grande at 10100-feet. However over 15% of the flora is non-native reflecting the legacy of historic landuse and modern disturbances. The monuments herbarium serves the dual purpose of documenting the monuments flora, while also providing a key botanical reference in support of research and monitoring efforts.",NA,NA,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/ih/herbarium_details.php?irn=","","",35.7651,-106.3221,2021,"plantae"
