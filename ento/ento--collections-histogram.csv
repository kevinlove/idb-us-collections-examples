It contains over 950,000 specimens, with Coleoptera (750,000+ specimens) and Lepidoptera (130,000+ specimens) as primary foci. The holdings include at least 18 primary types and 150 paratypes, and dates of collection span from 1878 to the present. The dung beetle collection is the largest in the United States, and our scarab holdings are particularly strong in African as well as regional material. The Colorado Scarab Survey and the Colorado Microlepidoptera Survey, both long-term projects initiated and conducted by DMNS, are steadily growing our regional holdings and our knowledge of the Colorado fauna. The collection is housed in the Avenir Collections Center - an onsite state-of-the-art museum collections facility.","",NA,TRUE,"","","1,000,000 specimens and specimen lots","Frank Krell","Curator of Entomology","frank.krell@dmns.org","2001 Colorado Blvd","Denver","Colorado","80205","2001 Colorado Blvd","Denver","Colorado","80205","urn:uuid:75a457ae-5214-4b6a-9eab-178d6cf4a780","","","","","","",39.7583,-104.9406,97395,"arthropoda"

The Academy has had several prominent entomologists in its history, primarily between 1930 and 1960. Donald C. Lowrie (1910-2000) studied spiders and their role in local dune ecosystems. Leonora K. Gloyd (b. 1902) conducted fieldwork on Odonata. Orlando Park published on the taxonomy and ecology of Coleoptera, particularly the Pselaphidae, in the 1940s. Stanley Auerbach researched centipedes in the Chicago area during the 1950s. Other major collectors include Andrew Bolter (collected between 1879-1910) and Harry D. Sicher (collected between 1940 and 1970), both of whom collected primarily Lepidoptera. The majority of the non-Lepidopteran specimens were collected in the Midwest and Western Great Lakes regions, with Canada, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. also represented. Lepidoptera primarily include species from the Midwestern U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico, Central and South America, Alaska, California, Florida, and the Southwestern U.S. Temporal Coverage of this collection is 1834-Present, with the bulk of the non-Lepidoptera specimens collected between 1872 and 1911, and the bulk of Lepidopteran specimens collected between 1891 and 1964.","",NA,NA,"Majority of collection consists of Lepidoptera.

All pinned or pointed specimens are stored in 21 Cornell or U.S. National Museum (12 drawers each) insect cabinets. Three of these cabinets contains study specimens of all major orders and families of insects and are directly accessible by students for study and reference purposes. In addition, five vial cabinets (10 drawers each) are for storage of specimens preserved in alcohol.. The collection also has approximately 1200 microscope slides that have been purchased commercially, prepared by students or the result of research projects. Total numbers of pinned or pointed specimens for major groups of insects in the collection are: Coleoptera 7025; Lepidoptera 3293; Diptera 2754; Hymenoptera 2533; Hemiptera 2615; Orthoptera 771; and Odonata 394. Some adults of these and other Orders are preserved in alcohol.  There are approximately 10,000 vials with alcohol-preserved adult and immature specimens. Most of these vials have multiple specimens and no attempt has been made to count each specimen. Many of the alcohol-preserved specimens are aquatic immature insects. There are several thousand specimens of Chironomidae larvae resulting from a multiple-year study of chironomid populations in Lake Winnebago and the feeding habits of lake sturgeon. The collection also includes approximately 9,000 Australian specimens most of which are aquatic species, especially Trichoptera larvae (3,922 specimens), all of which are identified to family and many to species. Essentially all specimens have appropriate collection data labels. Many of the specimens were donated by students enrolled in the entomology classes. Most of these are local, regional or state specimens. However, specimens have been collected throughout the U.S. In 2011 the UWOIC became a part of a regional (22 midwestern collections) digitization effort (Invertnet) funded by NSF’s Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections. Currently about 5,000 specimens have been digitized for this on-going project.","",200000,NA,"","","200000","Gene Drecktrah","Curator Emeritus","drecktra@uwosh.edu","Department of Biology 800 Algoma Blvd.","Oshkosh","Wisconsin","54901","Halsey 142 921 Elmwood Ave.","Oshkosh","Wisconsin","54901","urn:uuid:8c02bca2-8bdc-4cd5-b25f-3938adc9cf17","","","","","","",44.0233,-88.5476,37,"arthropoda"
